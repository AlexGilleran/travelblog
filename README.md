I thought I had a great idea for a startup, build a blog specifically for travel bloggers! Because I'm a programming genius 
and marketing was beneath me, I got this far before I realised that there's like twenty other sites that do this exact thing 
to various degrees of quality, and half of them have failed at it because the market's not very big and pro travel bloggers 
love wordpress. Has some cool tech though, particularly flow in the frontend talking to sangria in the backend that's talking
to postgres through slick.
